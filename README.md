# 🐶 Fresh Food Calculator

I made this small project first because I wanted to challenge myself to do something other than following a tutorial.

Second because my dog weight is changing and I need to recalculate her food portions every time. Now it's easier!

For all the values I used [Cachorro Verde](https://www.cachorroverde.com.br/) website, a famous reference in natural pet food in Brazil. 🍠🍅🥕
